## README Preface



You should use these materials with responsibility in mind.

The license I used is Creative Commons, which means you can *distribute*, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator, Xiaoyu Wang. However, I highly disencourage you from completely use whole or part of the pieces in this repository, as it's completely public for anyone, even university staff, and GPT, to access; which means others are more likely to identify elements that are not original in YOUR writings.

With that being said, you are free use this repository to get a grasp of what a college application writing CAN look like, and even, how it might look fun and creative in other's eyes.

You can learn to issue, or PR me here, if you have any questions. Otherwise talk to me in person.
